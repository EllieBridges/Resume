* My Resume App

This is a personal resume and portfolio of mini projects I've been working on. 

I wanted to create something with purpose, to make some people smile and help network with others in the industry. I also wanted to give myself confidence in my ability and although I'm just starting out to embrace and learn from the mistakes!

The main software used was Next.js, Tailwind CSS and Typescript, along with connecting to an API from API Ninjas!

It's the first time using this software, so I wanted to add in as much as I could to test out what it can do. I've been using React, CSS and untyped Javascript, so I wanted to jump out of the box. Yes the colours are bold, the design is garish, but I had fun linking the themes and creating consistency through the use of components, colour schemes and font families ...so if you leave with you eyes intact congratulations! My favourite way to learn is through 'doing' and just to get excited about what the things I've learned can do! 

As I create mini projects, I'll be sure to add them in!

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
